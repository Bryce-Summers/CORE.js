if is common for me to write a function as:

foo() ->

which is not caught by the coffeescript interpreter.

it should instead be written as:

foo: () ->


the @ sign must not be ommitted to ensure proper internal class scoping.


always put the trailing '()' braces after a function call, because otherwise it assumes you want the function and the function is true when you are conditioning on the return value.

--> Always Use foo(), not foo.


Make sure to spell thinks like isEmissiveSource correctly.

if a random undefined comes from a return array value, make sure ever part of that function returns a list of nulls of the appropiate length.


Ah!!! Since by BSP assumes that the first node to give a valid intersection is the closest one, the erroneous ray split was returned.

Never instantiate a vector with a non-0 z component!!! that breaks most of my 2D beam tracing assumptions!


Coffeescript doesn't scope local variables to for loops! Use class based variables instead... or a single workaround scope.
